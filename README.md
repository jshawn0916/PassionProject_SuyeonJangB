# Project: Journey Wishlist

## Overview

Welcome to the Journey Wishlist project! This passion project allows users to create and customize their travel experiences by registering destinations and combining them to form unique journeys. Users can manage their information, add multiple destinations, and create various journeys, providing a personalized and interactive travel planning experience.

## User Registration

### User Creation Page

To get started, users need to register on the platform. On the user creation page, enter the following information:
- Last Name
- First Name
- Email

Click the "Create" button to generate a new user. Multiple users can be created, and existing user information can be modified or deleted as needed.

## Destination Registration

### Destination List Page

Once a user is created, they can start building their journey by registering destinations. On the destination list page, users can provide the following information for each destination:
- Destination Name
- Category
- Location

As an example, let's register several destinations for a trip to the United States.

## Journeys Creation

After destinations are registered, users can create journeys by combining their desired destinations. For instance, create three journeys:
1. Trip to New York
2. Trip to Los Angeles
3. Nationwide trip across the United States

One destination can be included in multiple journeys, allowing users to mix and match their travel experiences.

## Challenges and Future Work

Understanding and implementing the relationship between destinations and journeys posed a challenge, but the functional aspects have been successfully implemented. Due to time constraints, some design aspects remain unfinished, and further enhancements can be made in the future.

Feel free to explore, create, and customize your dream journeys with the Journey Wishlist project! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please provide feedback.

Happy journey planning! üåç‚úàÔ∏è
